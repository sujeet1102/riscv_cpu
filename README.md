# RISC-V CPU Implementation on FPGA (de0-nano)
This repository is for the implementation of single-cycled unpipelined RISC-V CPU (RV32I ISA) on the Terasic de0-nano FPGA board. The project is build using Intel Quartus Prime Lite (version 20.1).<br>
This project is inspired from the book "Digital Design and Computer Architecture, RISC-V Edition" by Sarrah & David Harris.

Here's the Block Diagram of the CPU:<br>
